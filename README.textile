h1. PHP Sprocket

PHP Sprocket is a port of Sprockets - the ruby library for Javascript dependency management and concatenation. 
For syntax instructions visit http://getsprockets.org/installation_and_usage.

This fork is rewrite of the the original PHPSprockets by Stuart Loxton.
 
Major difference between the original port and this fork are:

* The main class file has been renamed to "Sprocket"
* Commands are now classes. It is easy to extend Sprocket with new commands.
* Instead of YML this fork uses INI files for providing constants.
* Easy to extend due more abstraction, setters and a array based option interface
* Seperate render stage (with autoRender option to mimic the original render-on-construct).
* Fully documented sourcecode with demo

h3. Installation

# Copy or modify the sprocketize.php and .htaccess to your webroot.
# Modify the require path to point to the 'lib' directory if necessary.
# Enjoy clean JavaScript

h3. Changes to the original sprockets.

PHP Sprockets currently acts as a transparent proxy as default and caches results. 
Because of this you do not have to initialize any classes in your app and sprocket stays separate.

For constants you can use either @<%=@ or @<?=@ this is to make the syntax closer to PHPs but still 
keep compatibility with original sprocket files.
